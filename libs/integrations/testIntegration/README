This is a test library to show how to create a dynamic library that will be the basis for a library interface to the WickrIO bots.  

The following are the function signatures that must be included in the dynamic library:

The following is a sample of what must be used to access the library from the WickrIO bot:

    QLibrary library("/opt/WickrIODebug/integrations/software/testIntegration/libtestIntegration.so");
    if (!library.load()) {
        qDebug() << "Could not load testintegration library";
    } else {
        qDebug() << "testintegration library loaded";
        typedef QString (*TestInputfunction)(QString input);
        TestInputfunction tf = (TestInputfunction)library.resolve("processInput");
        if (tf) {
            QString output = tf("This is a test message");
            if (output.isEmpty()) {
                qDebug() << "CONSOLE:received empty string";
            } else {
                qDebug() << "CONSOLE:Received:" << output;
            }
        }
    }
